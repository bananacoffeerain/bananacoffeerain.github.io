I am a User Experience (UX) Researcher at Google. I explore how consumers perceive ads and how to make their experience better. <br><br>

I am a mixed methods researcher and my research interests are broad and include : human-computer interaction, computer-mediated-communication, social computing, trust, engagement, literacy, and accessibility.<br><br> 

Prior to Google, I earned my PhD from the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I explored how time could be leveraged as a tailoring strategy for technology design. During my PhD program, I completed internships with HP, Yahoo and Google. I hold a MA in Communication and a BA in English Language and Literature both from Seoul National University in Korea.
